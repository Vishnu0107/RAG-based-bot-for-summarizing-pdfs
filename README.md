# RAG-based-bot-for-summarizing-pdfs

This is a RAG based bot which will process a pdf and summarizes it to the user. 
Here I am using a hugging face model which is available in this website : https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct

"data" this is a folder I am using to store all the pdfs. I used google colab to run the model however this even works if you use
your local system. The dependencies that needs to be installed will be listed in the following requirements.txt.
